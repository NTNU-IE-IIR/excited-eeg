# ExcITed - EEG
Excited project for developing EEG brainwave solutions for communication by ALS patients and other recipients.

The code and project is based on [Accessible virtual keyboard](https://github.com/accessible-virtual-keyboard), which was made as a
bachelor project in 2017.

#### The current goals of the project are as follows
1. Get the application from 2017 up and running.
2. Upgrade the code to make it compatible with current operating-systems/platforms, EEG equipment and software.
3. Improve and generalise the code, with the intend to make a clear separation between the code and the UI and EEG equipment.  
4. Improve the accessible virtual keyboard app as a demonstration example "demo-app" and 
    - Adapt the app for the ALS patients and non-technical users
    - Test the app on both healthy users and ALS patients
5. Document the work and create
    - Getting Started Guide
    - User Manual
    - documentation for the "demo-app"
